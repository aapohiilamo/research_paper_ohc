#You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following.

#1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
#2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
#3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
#4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
#5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of 
#   each variable for each activity and each subject.

#STEP   1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.

# 1 A.   READING DATA

#READ SUBJECT IDS
#READ ACTIVITY IDS
## READ activity master
## READING features.txt has the column headers
##READ DATA -TEST 
##READ DATA -TRAIN

source("loadFiles.R")

# 1 B.  DATA CLEANING AND RESHAPING
#ADDING ACTIVITY DESCRIPTION
#CREATING SUBJECT-ACTIVITY WITH ACTIVITY DESCRIPTION INSTEAD OF CODE
#ASSIGNING FEATURE ROWS AS COLUMN HEADER TO BOTH TEST AND TRAIN DATA
#ADDING SUBJECT & ACTIVITY DESCRIPTION TO BOTH TEST AND TRAIN DATA
#MERGING DATA 

source("reshapeCleanMerge.R")


#STEP 2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
# AND
#STEP 3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
